# Hands-On Practice - Build a CDE using DevSpace and Rancher Desktop
Goal: create a powerful Kubernetes-based setup for local development that simulates a production-like cloud environment. Rancher Desktop provides a Kubernetes cluster on your local machine, while DevSpace helps you streamline development workflows, such as code syncing, live-reloading, and debugging in Kubernetes.

## Prerequisites
- [Rancher Desktop](https://rancherdesktop.io/): Installed and configured to run a local Kubernetes cluster.
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/): Installed and configured to interact with your Rancher Desktop Kubernetes cluster.
- [DevSpace](https://www.devspace.sh/): Installed via the DevSpace CLI for Kubernetes development workflows.

## Installation Instructions:
- Rancher Desktop: [Download and install Rancher Desktop](Download and install Rancher Desktop) for your platform (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
- kubectl: Rancher Desktop installs `kubectl` automatically. Verify by running: `kubectl version --client`
- DevSpace: Install DevSpace by running the right command from [here](https://www.devspace.sh/docs/getting-started/installation)
